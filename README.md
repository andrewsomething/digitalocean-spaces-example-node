# DigitalOcean Spaces for Node.js Sample Project

[DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/storage/object-storage/) was designed to be compatible with the AWS S3 API. This simple Node.js application illustrates the usage of the AWS SDK for Node.js with Spaces. It connects to the Spaces API, creates a Space, and uploads a file to it. 

## Getting Started
